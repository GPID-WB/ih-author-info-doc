## Overview {.unnumbered}

The *PIP Innovation Hub* is intended to be a home for innovative work on poverty measurement, displaying experimental estimates using alternative methods to those currently shown in the [Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)](pip.worldbank.org). The Hub will showcase these estimates in an interactive dashboard, display the methodological notes, and link to any associated papers to highlight the work further.

This document describes the specific inputs required from featured authors, in order to showcase their work.

## About the Innovation Hub

The objective of PIP Innovation Hub is to foster innovation, by providing poverty and inequality estimates that use alternative methods to tackle some of the biggest measurement challenges, and show the impact of different methodological decisions.

Some of the main criteria for showcased work include:

-   Methods should be "generalizible", that is, that provide global or regional estimates of poverty, or that span a large number of countries (i.e., not country-specific innovations).

-   must describe the issue with current poverty and inequality estimates intended to be addressed;

-   estimates must be tagged to a particular PIP vintage to foster comparability and interoperability with the latest estimates;

-   must be uploaded to the Development Data Hub with metadata and description to guide users;

-   and must be described in a PRWP, a Global Poverty Monitoring Technical Note (GPMTN), or a published paper.

## Submission Requirements

Thank you for being part of PIP Innovation Hub!

Authors wishing to showcase their work in PIP Innovation Hub are required to submit three main inputs: 1) a `.dta` file fulfilling the stated requirements with the global, regional and/or country-level poverty estimates produced from their method; 2) metadata information; and 3), a brief methodological note. The details and specific formats for each component are described as follows:

### Data file

As stated above, data submitted must contain global and/or regional estimates of poverty or at least span many countries. It shoudl algo be tagged to a particular PIP vintage to foster comparability and interoperability with the latest estimates Data must be submitted in `.dta` format. The following is a template with the specific columns and labels to be included:

`dta_template.dta`

\[[should we include a table with vars here?]{style="color:red"}\]

### Metadata file

The metadata file consists on all relevant information on your paper such as title, description, dates, URLs, indicators and economies included/excluded, etc. This information must be submitted through an Excel file, filling out one single row with 21 columns:

`metadata_template.xlsx`

### Methodological Note

Finally, authors should provide brief details on the approach in a methodological note, describing the issue with current poverty/inequality estimates it is trying to address. This note should not be longer than 3 paragraphs, and must include official link to paper.

## Submission Portal

Finally, the three inputs described in the previous section must be submitted through the following portal:
